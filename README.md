# Usage

- Install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file, for example using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Rename `config-sample.py` to `config.py` and fill in your information.

# Additional notes

- Python 2 does not work (at least, that's what my experience was) - use Python 3 instead
